  <h1>E-Learning App</h1>
  <p>The E-Learning App is an innovative educational platform that enables interactive learning by connecting teachers and students. It offers functionalities such as chat, quizzes, attendance tracking, and a resource hub for educational materials.</p>
  
  <h2>Key Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Interactive chat system for teacher-student communication</li>
    <li>Quiz creation for student assessment</li>
    <li>Attendance tracking to monitor student participation</li>
    <li>Uploading and managing educational materials</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
  <p>This app is built with Kotlin and follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern for a clean and maintainable code structure. LiveData is used for data observation, Retrofit for network operations, and Firebase for real-time database and authentication services. Dependency Injection is implemented using Hilt, and Coroutines manage background tasks efficiently.</p>
  
  <h3>MVVM</h3>
  <p>MVVM stands for Model-View-ViewModel. It is an architectural pattern that facilitates a separation of development of the graphical user interface from the business logic. The ViewModel serves as a bridge between the Model and the View, providing hooks for the View to pass events to the Model.</p>
  
  <h3>LiveData</h3>
  <p>LiveData is a lifecycle-aware observable data holder class. It ensures the UI matches the data state and allows for the decoupling of different modules, simplifying the development process and preventing memory leaks.</p>
  
  <h3>Retrofit</h3>
  <p>Retrofit is a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java, which simplifies networking in your app by turning HTTP API into a Java interface.</p>
  
  <h3>Firebase</h3>
  <p>Firebase provides a suite of cloud services for mobile and web applications, including real-time databases, authentication, and hosting.</p>
  
  <h3>Dependency Injection</h3>
  <p>Dependency Injection is a design pattern that allows the creation of dependent objects outside of a class and provides those objects to a class in different ways.</p>
  
  <h3>Coroutines</h3>
  <p>Coroutines are a Kotlin feature that converts async callbacks for long-running tasks, such as database or network access, into sequential code.</p>
  
  <h3>Hilt</h3>
  <p>Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the manual labor of coding dependencies across the project.</p>
